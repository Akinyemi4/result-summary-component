## Overview

This is my solution to a challenge on frontendMentor.io titled "Result-summary-component". It's a challenge for labelled "newbie" on the website. It helps to practice one's ability of html and Css.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

- I was able to do a warmup of my Html and Css skills.
- I learnt how to link and use variable fonts.

### Continued development

I'd like to learn how to layout elements better and faster without relying much on padding and margin.

### Useful resources

- [VARIABLE FONTS: Kelvin Powell](https://youtu.be/0fVymQ7SZw0) - This helped me to better understand variable fonts.
